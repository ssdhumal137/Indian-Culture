                <h2>Shiv-puran</h2>
                <p>According to the legend, Sage Vasugupta received a divine revelation in a dream where Lord Shiva
                    instructed him to seek out a specific stone near a serene stream. To his amazement, the stone turned
                    over at his touch, revealing the sacred Shiva Sutras etched upon its surface. These profound sutras,
                    reserved for those deemed worthy of divine grace, unravel the mysteries of our true nature and the
                    illusory existence we inhabit. Ranjit Chaudhri has translated some important texts of Kashmir
                    Shaivism from Sanskrit into English. These include 112 Meditations for Self Realization: The Vigyan
                    Bhairava Tantra, The Shiva Sutras: Eternal Wisdom for Life, and Sounds of Liberation: The Spanda

                    tohave been composed between 1000 - 600 BCE, theYajurveda 'Samhita', or 'compilation', contains
                    theliturgy (mantras) needed to perform the sacrifices ofthe Veda, and the added Brahmana
                    andShrautasutra add information on the interpretationand on the details of their performance. This
                    is the last of the Griffith Veda translations to be digitized.</p>

                    <h1>Athhrvveda</h1>
                    The Atharvaveda is a sacred text of Hinduism and one of the four Vedas, often called the "fourth
                    Veda". According to tradition, the Atharvaveda was mainly composed by two groups of rishis known as
                    the Atharvanas and the Angirasa. In the Late Vedic Gopatha Brahmana, it is attributed to the Bhrigu
                    and Angirasa. The Atharvaveda, while undoubtedly belonging to the core Vedic corpus, in some ways
                    represents an independent parallel tradition to that of the Rig-Veda and Yajurveda. It incorporates
                    much of the early traditions of healing and magic that are paralleled in other Indo-European
                    literatures</p>

                    <h1>Samveda</h1>
                    The Sama Veda is the third of the four Vedas, the ancient core Hindu scriptures, along with the Rig
                    Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. Its earliest parts are believed to date from 1700 BC (since all
                    of its verses are from the Rigveda) and it ranks next in sanctity and liturgical importance to the
                    Rigveda. It consists of a collection (samhita) of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses, all
                    but 75 taken from the Sakala Sakha of the Rigveda, the other 75 belong to the Bashkala Sakha, to be
                    sung, using specifically indicated melodies called Samagana, by Udgatar priests at sacrifices in
                    which the juice of the Soma plant, clarified and mixed with milk and other ingredients, is offered
                    in libation to various deities</p>
